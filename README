2732_MMS84A_MagnoliaMMS.BIN
	The Magnolia Microsystems version "A" of the 444-84 H89 System ROM.
	Patched to correct a problem during transfer (missing JMP opcode at 0000).

2732a_444_84b_mms.bin
	The Magnolia Microsystems version "B" of the 444-84 H89 System ROM.

2732a_444_84c_ide_mms_v1.bin
	MMS-84B monitor ROM image, modified by Norberto Collado.

H19.jar
	A java-based H19 emulator. Use "loopback" option to run offline (keyboard
	looped-back to screen). Without loopback, will display characters received
	on stdin and send keystrokes to stdout.

H89.jar
	A java-based H89-enabled H19 emulator. Provides a menu framework and
	invokes the VirtualH89 emulator as a back-end process.

H89jni.jar
	A java-based H89-enabled H19 emulator that uses JNI (Java Native Interface)
	to directly load and execute the emulator from "libV89JNI.so".

README.config
	Information on configuring environment variables and properties
	for running the VirtualH89.

README.mms77316
	Information on properties and files to support the MMS 77316 Floppy controller.

README.mms77320
	Information on properties and files to support the MMS 77320 SASI adapter.

README.cpnet
	Information on properties and files to support the CPNetDevice pseudo-device.

README.cpm3
	Information on running CP/M Plus (v3.1)

v89rc.example
	An example config/properties file for H19.jar, H89.jar, and the
	VirtualH89 emulator.

Makefile.VirtualH89
	A sample Makefile for linux/Unix systems to build the VirtualH89 emulator.

v89.tgz
	MMS-Only snapshot of code, an earlier branch of Mark's VirtualH89 emulator.
	The tarball does not specify a subdirectory, so do "mkdir xxx; cd xxx"
	before unpacking. Use "make jni" to build the libV89JNI.so required by
	H89jni.jar. With both the jar and .so (and .v89rc) in current directory,
	the startup command would be:

		java -jar H89jni.jar

	Or to specify another v89rc file:

		V89_CONFIG=/some/place/v89rc java -jar H89jni.jar
