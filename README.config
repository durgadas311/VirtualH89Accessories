==== Configuration of the VirtualH89 program ====

Environment Variables:

	V89_CONFIG
		The config/properties file to use.

Properties Recognized:

VirtualH89:
	sw501
		The binary code to use for the SW501 settings. MSB=sw8.
		e.g. sw501 = 00000000

	slot_p504, slot_p505, slot_p506
		Designate controller card(s) installed. Currently only recognizes
		"MMS77316". Slot assignment is currently arbitrary.
		e.g. slot_p504 = MMS77316

	monitor_rom
		The image to use for the monitor ROM. Without this, the emulator
		chooses a built-in ROM images based on compile options.
		e.g. monitor_rom = 2732_MMS84A_MagnoliaMMS.BIN

	mms77316_drive*
	mms77316_disk*
		See README.mms77316 for information on the MMS 77316 Floppy Adapter.

        mms77320_port
        mms77320_intr
        mms77320_dipsw
        mms77320_dir
		See README.mms77320 for information on the MMS 77320 SASI Adapter.

	cpnetdevice_port
	cpnetdevice_clientid
	hostfilebdos_root_dir
		See README.cpnet for information on the CP/Net pseudo-adapter.

	z17_disk[1-3], z37_disk[1-4], z47_disk[1-2]
		The initial disk image inserted into drives on the respective controllers.
		Support is pending.

H89.jar:
	h89_nameplate
		Text to display on the housing nameplate. If value is "none",
		then the GUI shows only the CRT screen and no additional decoration.
		An empty or missing property defaults to "Heathkit H89".

	h89_cmd_line
		The commandline string to use to invoke the H89 back-end.
		Use with caution. Default is "./v89 -q -g proxy". The main use
		would be to change the name and/or path to the emulator.
		For the VirtualH89 emulator, the options shown are absolute minimum.
		e.g. h89_cmd_line = ./v89 -q -g proxy

H19.jar (and H89.jar):
	h19_font
		The font to use. The builtin font H19a.ttf is the default.
		e.g. h19_font = H19a.ttf

	h19_font_size
		The font size to use. For default font, it seems only multiples
		of 10 render cleanly. 20 or 30 seem practical.
		e.g. h19_font_size = 20

	h19_font_color
		The color of the font (CRT phosphor). Expressed in 24-bit RGB hexadecimal.
		e.g. h19_font_color = 00ff00

	h19_beep
		The audio file to use for the terminal beep (response to ASCII BEL code).
		Default is h19beep.wav which is a 500mS 1024Hz beep. Others builtin are:
			h19beep.wav	500mS 1024Hz
			h19beep250.wav	250mS 1024Hz
			h19beep125.wav	125mS 1024Hz
			h19click.wav	 62mS 1024Hz
			h19click031.wav	 31mS 1024Hz
			h19click015.wav	 15mS 1024Hz
			h19click007.wav	  7mS 1024Hz
		e.g. h19_beep = h19beep250.wav

	h19_beep_volume
		Volume setting to use when beeping, expressed as percentage of max.
		e.g. h19_beep_volume = 30

	h19_s401, h19_s402
		H19 configuration dipswitch settings. See H19 documentation.
		Note, first bit is sw 7, "1" = "on". S401 is UART settings
		which are ignored. Default: h19_s402=00000110.

	h19_nameplate
		Same as h89_nameplate.
